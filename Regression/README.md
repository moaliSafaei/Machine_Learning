## Dielectric Performance Prediction by Non-linear regression


Dielectrics are used in capacitors and semiconductor devices, hold immense promise for novel applications like artificial muscles. Furthermore, predicting their failure mode is of great importance. 
To address this issue, a generic example named Example_2 is presented:
### Key Steps:
 1. Assessing Performance: A comprehensive dataset is employed to assess dielectric performance.
 2. Prediction Approach: A non-linear regression method predicts material performance based on the maximum voltage applied to dielectrics.
 3. Educational Purpose: This example serves as a basic tutorial for students, introducing them to regression approaches.
 4. Code Reference: The Jupyter notebook “Nonlinear_Regression.ipynb” contains the implementation.
 5. Three different Kernel are implemented: RBF (Radial Basis Function), Second-order polynomial kernel and Sigmoid kernels
 6. L2-Regularization is applied to the models.
Moreover, they are implemented in a straightforward manner. Therefore, it’s useful to explore them through a basic example.
