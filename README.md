This repository showcases two illustrative examples, shedding light on the power of learning-based methods.

## Example 1: Breast Cancer Prediction

Breast cancer is a global health concern, demanding urgent attention. Just in 2020 alone, breast cancer claimed 685,000 lives worldwide. Hence, acccurate prediction of breast cancer plays a crucial role in our current world. 
For this manner, a typical example is predicted, here:
The dataset, named “breast_cancer.csv,” serves as the foundation for this example.
The predictive model is implemented in the Jupyter notebook file titled “LogisticRegression_Prediction.ipynb”

### Key Steps:
 1. Data Preprocessing: Detecting and handling missing values and outliers.
 2. Feature Visualization: Properly visualizing the distribution of dataset features.
 3. Correlation Analysis: Estimating the impact of different parameters on each class.
 4. Model Training: Employing the Logistic Regression approach.
 5. Model Assessment: Evaluating the model using the Confusion Matrix.


## Example 2: Dielectric Performance Prediction

Dielectrics in Industry: These materials, used in capacitors and semiconductor devices, hold immense promise for applications like artificial muscles.
 1. Assessing Performance: A comprehensive dataset is employed to assess dielectric performance.
 2. Prediction Approach: A non-linear regression method predicts material performance based on the maximum voltage applied to dielectrics.
 3. Educational Purpose: This example serves as a basic tutorial for students, introducing them to regression approaches.
 4. Code Reference: The Jupyter notebook “Nonlinear_Regression.ipynb” contains the implementation.
 5. Three different Kernel are implemented: RBF (Radial Basis Function), Second-order polynomial kernel and Sigmoid kernels
 6. L2-Regularization is applied to the models.

These examples demonstrate the intersection of theory, data, and practical applications, fostering a deeper understanding of machine learning and its impact on real-world challenges.
